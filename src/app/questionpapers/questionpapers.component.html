    <span class="headingCustom">Read the following passage and answer the question given below:</span>
    Burnout is becoming increasingly prevalent among teachers and coaches. Burnout can be defined as physical, emotional and attitudinal exhaustion. There are many causes of teacher burnout. Lack of administrative support, lack of input into the curriculum process, public criticism and the accompanying lack of community support are all factors contributing to burnout. Inadequate salaries, discipline problems too little time to do the ever growing amount of work, large class sizes, and heavier teaching loads may also contribute to this problem. The lack of challenge, inadequate supervisory feedback and the absence of opportunities for personal and professional growth may also lead to burnout.
    In the coaching realm burnout may be caused by competitive seasons that seem to go on without end, administrative and community pressures and time pressures. Teacher-coach role conflict occurs when a disparity exists between the expectations associated with being a teacher and a coach, these results in a multitude of simultaneous, somewhat diverse demands. The teacher coach unable to satisfy these demands, experiences role conflict.
    In both the teaching and coaching realms, personal problems may interact with professional problems to exacerbate burnout. Personal problems such as conflicts within one’s family, money difficulties, or perhaps problems with relationships may cause additional stress for the individual. These stresses coupled with professional problems may hasten the onset of burnout.
    The consequences of burnout are many and are often quite severe, affecting teachers as well as their students. The most critical impact of burnout may be on instruction. Burned out teachers may cope with the demands of teaching by sitting on theside lines.

      Question 71 to 75:
      Read the passage and answer the questions that follow based on your understanding of the passage:
      There are many problems and challenges facing educators in general and physical educators in particular. Pertinent question is what is the place and function of physical education in education? Can we justify physical education as a part of education curriculum? Can we justify requiring it for all students? In a time of accountability we must show that physical education has a definite, positive value in the educational process, and we need to show why physical education is a vital part of the curriculum.
      At the same time, questionable practices are attracting more attention to mismanaged sports and physical education programmes. Also, many benefits promised by these programmes are now coming under fire as unproven or unprovable benefits. It is argued that “games quickly lose their charm when forced into the service of education, character development, or social improvement.
      Many curricular problems exist in education and physical education. In addition to the need to make the curriculum more relevant, we need to establish educational priorities for our society if we are to settle some of the long-standing issues. We need to end the separation of reality and education. We do not want to plan an inflexible curriculum. We must be open to change and innovation. Students need to have options that will permit them the optimum realization of their latent talents. For this reason the students need to be included in program planning and evaluation, for the programs are supposed to be designed to benefit the students, not the teachers.
      We also face the challenge of developing more and better leaders. There is a need for the academic physical educator with strong skills in all the communication. Physical educators have not been very successful in communicating either the values of physical education or the need for physical education to the public. The new physical educator needs to be very skill oriented, capable of demonstrating as well as teaching the skills used in any class. At the same time, he or she must be broadly educated in the liberal arts and sciences in order to be able to converse meaningfully with people in all academic fields. We need to work to close the gap between our current teaching methods and facts and what we discovered about teaching and skill acquisition in research. We have allowed a gap to appear between the physical educators who are researchers and those who are practitioners. We need to work to see that we improve the practice of physical education as a result of the research we are doing in physical education.
      Readiness for change is a necessary ability or outlook in modern society. Change is inevitable, those who are more adapt at survival will be prepared to accept change and learn to adopt. Education faces the difficult task of trying to develop this readiness for change or adaptability, for it must prepare people not only for what is, but also for what will be, even though what is to come is unknown. Physical education is a worthy field for in its activities and experiences we can find elements of value to people of all ages and conditions. The greatest question that faces physical educators today is the future of physical education. What directions will physical education take under your guidance and leadership?
